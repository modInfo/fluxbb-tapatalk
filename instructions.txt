  1. Edit template_readme.txt and save it as readme.txt.
  
  
  2. Additional source files have to be placed in the /files/ directory. 

  
  3. Open up install_mod.php and edit it to your liking. NOTE: You should
     only include the mod install script if your mod requires running SQL-
     queries against the database during installation. If your mod does not
     alter the database layout or contents in any way, you should remove
     install_mod.php.
          
  
  4. We encourage you to make your modification translatable. This can easily
     be achieved by defining your strings in /files/lang/English/mod_name.php
     (Do not forget to alter the name of the language file)
     
     In your source code, you then have to include the language definitions:
     
     
if (file_exists(PUN_ROOT.'lang/'.$pun_user['language'].'/mod_name.php'))
     	
require PUN_ROOT.'lang/'.$pun_user['language'].'/mod_name.php';
     
else
     	require PUN_ROOT.'lang/English/mod_name.php';
     	
     
Now simply use $lang_mod_name['Example'] instead of hardcoded strings.

  
5. Archive the files together in an archive (zip, tar.gz, tar.bz2 or rar) with
    
 all (if any) other files your mod needs.

 
 6. Visit the FluxBB Modification Repository at http://fluxbb.org/resources/mods/ 
     and upload your mod through the upload interface.

  
Version numbering: The first release of a mod should always be 1.0. 1.0.1
                     
is a bug fix release based on 1.0. If the new version
                     
offers added features or a large number of bugfixes it
                     
could be called 1.1. Stepping up to version 2.0 would
  more or less require a complete rewrite of the mod.
